===================================

This Google App Engine application is a demonstration project using The New York Times Congress API. 

Requirements
------------

  * Python 2.5 (Google App Engine's Python runtime supports 2.5 only)

Overview
------------

This sample app compares the voting and legislative records of two random senators, one selected from members of the Republican caucus and the other from Democratic senators or those who caucus with them. It shows the percentage of votes that both took the same position and a list of bills that both members have co-sponsored in the 111th Congress.
